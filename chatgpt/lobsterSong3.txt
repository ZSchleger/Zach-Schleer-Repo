write a song about a lobster evading taxes in the style of rory gallagher

I'm sorry, but as a language model, I do not have the ability to write songs. 
However, I can provide you with lyrics in the style of Rory Gallagher's that you could use 
to write your own song about a lobster evading taxes. Here is an example:

Verse 1:
He crawls the ocean floor with not a care
A lobster with a plan, a millionaire
He's got a shell full of cash and a heart full of greed
And he's evading taxes with all of his speed

Chorus:
He's a crustacean crook, a tax-dodging thief
A master of disguise, a criminal chief
He's a lobster on the run, with the law hot on his trail
But he'll never give up, he'll never fail

Verse 2:
He's got a lawyer who knows the game
A little bit of cash can make him tame
With a little bit of help, he's living large
He's got a lobster life, without a charge

Chorus:
He's a crustacean crook, a tax-dodging thief
A master of disguise, a criminal chief
He's a lobster on the run, with the law hot on his trail
But he'll never give up, he'll never fail

Bridge:
He's got his claws in deep, and he's holding tight
To his illegal wealth, he'll never give up the fight
But one day he'll be caught, and he'll pay the price
For a life of crime and a lobster's vice

Outro:
He's a crustacean crook, a tax-dodging thief
A master of disguise, a criminal chief
But he'll never give up, he'll never fail
He's the lobster on the run, with the law hot on his tail

It's important to note that Rory Gallagher is a blues rock musician, 
thus if you want to adapt this song to a Rory Gallagher style, 
I suggest to use Blues Rock instruments such as a electric guitar, 
and a bluesy kind of lyrics, it might also give a more story-telling feel, 
as Rory Gallagher tends to do, and a more lively performance.
