write a song about a lobster evading taxes in the style of the doors

Verse 1:
He crawls out of the sea
With money hidden in his claw
He's evading taxes, you see
And the government's on a raw

Chorus:
He's a lobster on the run
He's got money and he's having fun
But the law is closing in
He's a lobster living in sin

Verse 2:
He hides out in the rocks
And he dances to the moon's light
He's got a knack for off-shore stocks
And he's living out of sight

Chorus:
He's a lobster on the run
He's got money and he's having fun
But the law is closing in
He's a lobster living in sin

Verse 3:
He's got a taste for fine champagne
And he's living like a king
But he knows he's playing a dangerous game
And he's waiting for the sting

Chorus:
He's a lobster on the run
He's got money and he's having fun
But the law is closing in
He's a lobster living in sin

Outro:
He's a lobster on the run
But he knows he can't hide forever
He's got to face what he's done
And the price that he must pay
He's a lobster living in sin
But he's got a taste of the good life
And he's laughing all the way.
